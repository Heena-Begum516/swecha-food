# Swecha Food â€“ Telugu Recipe App Report

## 1. Introduction
Swecha Food is a simple and user-friendly Streamlit application designed to help users search and view traditional Telugu recipes stored as text files. This project aims to preserve cultural recipes and make them easily accessible through a lightweight web app.

## 2. Objectives
- Create a searchable recipe database using text files.
- Support Telugu language recipes with UTF-8 encoding.
- Provide a clean and intuitive user interface with Streamlit.
- Enable easy deployment on local machines and Streamlit Cloud.

## 3. Methodology
- Recipes are stored as individual `.txt` files inside a local `data` folder.
- The app loads all text files dynamically at runtime.
- User inputs keywords via a text input box.
- The app searches for the keyword in both file names and contents (case-insensitive).
- Matching recipes are displayed on the interface.
- Python and Streamlit form the backbone of the application.

## 4. Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit for web interface
- UTF-8 encoding to support Telugu script
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## 5. Challenges Faced
- Ensuring proper encoding and display of Telugu characters.
- Designing a simple but effective search mechanism without a database.
- Handling dynamic file loading efficiently.

## 6. Results
- Successfully implemented a recipe search app supporting Telugu text.
- Achieved dynamic loading of recipe files with smooth search experience.
- Developed deployment-ready code for both local and cloud environments.

## 7. Future Work
- Add advanced search filters (e.g., by ingredients or cooking time).
- Include images or videos for recipes.
- Support multi-language translation.
- Integrate a database for scalability.

## 8. Conclusion
The Swecha Food app demonstrates how traditional recipes can be preserved digitally using modern tools. It provides an accessible platform for Telugu food lovers and serves as a foundation for further enhancements.
